//! # Database Utilities Module
//!
//! This module makes room for common utility routines used throughout the
//! `crate::database` module. This does not include any implementation-specific
//! behavior; in particular, each database is to own a `util` module as needed,
//! leaving this for cases where their functionality intersects.
